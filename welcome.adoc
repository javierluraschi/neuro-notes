*Neuroscience Fundamentals: Biological Components for Artificial Intelligence* presents the building blocks discovered by neuroscientists which might be required to build intelligent systems.

This book is intended to be read by people working in fields like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence[artificial intelligence], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning[deep learning], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning[machine learning] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering[software engineering]. It is a summary of *neuroscience for engineers*, it does not present any grand theory of intelligence -- it's left to the reader to apply neuroscience theories to build more useful and intelligent systems on their own.

This book follows the structure of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Neural_Science[Principles of Neural Science], a masterpiece lead by Nobel laureate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kandel[Eric Kandel], whom we greatly credit this book to.
