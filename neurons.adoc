= Neurons

Must Learm:
- Channels
- Types
  - Voltage Gated
- Depolarization / Repolarization / Hyperpolarization
- Na+, K+, Cl-
- Channels In Neurons
  - Most: Voltage-gates, Na+ inward, K+ outward.
  - Voltage-gated Ca2+ opened in response to depolarization, inward Ca to helpdepolarize
  - Some neurons have voltage-gated Cl- to help repolarization
  - Some voltage-avtivated K+ channels differ in
